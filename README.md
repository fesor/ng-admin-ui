Angular Admin UI
=================================

This is an proof-of-concept project of building highly user friendly admin board as SPA. Currently it's only an prototype to test all ideas which swarming in my head.

## Main Goals
- Use adaptive design to improve UX on tablets. Devices with screen size less than 7" are not considered as targeting devices.
- Provide set of reusable components for rapid admin boards development
- Provide something better than stupid/ugly data-grids
